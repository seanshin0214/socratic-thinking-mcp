# Assumption Testing

## Category
CRITICAL & SYSTEMS THINKING

## Description
Systematically identifies and tests the hidden assumptions underlying a plan, decision, or belief. By making assumptions explicit and testing them, you reduce blind spots and increase the robustness of your thinking.

## When to Use
- High-stakes decisions
- New product launches
- Strategic planning
- Risk assessment
- Validating business models
- Before major investments

## Question Sequence (5 questions)

### Question 1/5: IDENTIFY ASSUMPTIONS
What are you assuming must be true for [plan/decision] to succeed? List at least 10 assumptions.

**Purpose:** Surface hidden beliefs

### Question 2/5: CLASSIFY ASSUMPTIONS
For each assumption, is it: (A) Critical - failure if wrong, (B) Important - problematic if wrong, or (C) Minor - manageable if wrong?

**Purpose:** Prioritize testing efforts

### Question 3/5: TEST FEASIBILITY
For your critical (A) assumptions: What evidence do you have that each is actually true? What would prove it false?

**Purpose:** Validate with data

### Question 4/5: IDENTIFY RISKS
Which critical assumption is LEAST likely to be true? What happens if it's wrong?

**Purpose:** Find the weakest link

### Question 5/5: CREATE TESTS
How can you test your riskiest assumption quickly and cheaply before fully committing?

**Purpose:** Design experiments to validate

## Expected Outcome
- 10-15 assumptions identified
- Top 3-5 critical assumptions prioritized
- Evidence gaps revealed
- Testing plan created
- Reduced blind spot risk

## Tips
- Assume nothing is "obvious"
- Test the scariest assumption first
- Look for assumptions about customers, market, technology, operations
- Ask "What would have to be true for this to work?"
- Design cheap tests (surveys, prototypes, pilots)
