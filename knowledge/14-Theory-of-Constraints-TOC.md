# Theory of Constraints (TOC) - Thinking Process

## Category
CRITICAL & SYSTEMS THINKING

## Description
Developed by Eliyahu Goldratt, TOC focuses on identifying and eliminating the single biggest constraint (bottleneck) limiting system performance. Based on the insight that every system has ONE constraint at any given time, and improving anything else is suboptimal.

## When to Use
- System performance optimization
- Operational efficiency
- Process improvement
- Project management
- Strategic planning
- Productivity enhancement

## Question Sequence (5 questions)

### Question 1/5: IDENTIFY THE CONSTRAINT
In your system (business, project, process), what is the ONE bottleneck that limits overall throughput? Where is the slowest point that everything else waits for?

**Purpose:** Find the limiting factor

### Question 2/5: EXPLOIT THE CONSTRAINT
How can you get the maximum output from the existing constraint WITHOUT major investment? How can you ensure the constraint never sits idle or wastes capacity?

**Purpose:** Optimize current bottleneck

### Question 3/5: SUBORDINATE EVERYTHING ELSE
How should you adjust all other parts of the system to support the constraint? What should you STOP doing because it doesn't help the constraint?

**Purpose:** System-wide alignment

### Question 4/5: ELEVATE THE CONSTRAINT
If exploiting isn't enough, how can you add capacity to the constraint? What investment (people, technology, process) would break through this bottleneck?

**Purpose:** Increase constraint capacity

### Question 5/5: RINSE AND REPEAT
Once this constraint is broken, what becomes the NEW constraint? (Don't let inertia become the constraint - keep improving)

**Purpose:** Continuous improvement loop

## Expected Outcome
- Bottleneck clearly identified
- Non-bottleneck optimization avoided (wasted effort)
- System-wide performance improved
- Resources focused on highest-leverage activity
- Continuous improvement mindset

## Tips
- Only ONE constraint matters at a time
- Don't optimize non-constraints (creates inventory/waste)
- "An hour lost at the bottleneck is an hour lost for the entire system"
- "An hour saved at a non-bottleneck is a mirage"
- Measure: Throughput (value created), Inventory (WIP), Operating Expense
- Common constraints: People skills, equipment capacity, market demand, policy/rules
