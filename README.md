## 💡 Why This Exists

Most AI tools **give you answers**.
This MCP **asks you questions** instead.

Like Socrates, it guides you to discover insights through structured questioning - using **78+ proven methodologies** from business strategy, creative thinking, and critical analysis.

## ✨ What Makes This Different

## 🎬 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Career Decision
```
User: "Should I do a Babson DBA in Entrepreneurship?"

MCP recommends: Decision Tree, Regret Minimization, Cost-Benefit
User selects: Decision Tree

Q1: What's the core decision?
A1: Whether Babson DBA adds value to my career

Q2: What are your options?
A2: 1) Do DBA now, 2) Wait 2 years, 3) Do executive program instead

Q3: Expected outcomes?
A3: DBA = deep research skills + network ($120K, 4 years)
    Executive = quick network ($15K, 2 weeks)

Q4: Probability and value?
A4: Success 80% but opportunity cost is high (already have EdD + 2 PhDs in progress)

Q5: Best choice and why?
A5: Executive program - achieves 70% of goal in 5% of time/cost
```

### Example 2: Product Innovation
```
User: "How can we improve our mobile app?"

MCP recommends: SCAMPER, Question Storming, Jobs To Be Done
User selects: Question Storming

Q1: WHAT IS? - What's the current situation?
A1: Users drop off after 3 days, engagement is low

Q2: WHAT CAUSED? - Root factors?
A2: Onboarding is confusing, value prop unclear

Q3: WHAT IF? - No constraints?
A3: Personalized AI coach for each user

2. **Submarine Mode** - Silent until triggered, no token waste
3. **Methodology Transparency** - Always shows which method is being used
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Questions revealed step-by-step
5. **User Agency** - User chooses methodology, not imposed
6. **RAG-Ready** - Knowledge base optimized for retrieval
