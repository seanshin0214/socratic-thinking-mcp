# Cynefin Framework

## Category
CRITICAL & SYSTEMS THINKING

## Description
A sense-making framework developed by Dave Snowden that helps classify problems into five domains: Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, and Confused. Different problem types require fundamentally different approaches.

## When to Use
- Unclear what type of problem you face
- Strategy selection
- Team disagreement on approach
- Crisis response
- Change management
- Leadership decision-making

## Question Sequence (5 questions)

### Question 1/5: CAUSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP
When you act, is the outcome: (A) Predictable and repeatable, (B) Discoverable through analysis, (C) Only visible in retrospect, or (D) Completely unclear?

**Purpose:** Identify domain (Clear/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic)

### Question 2/5: EXPERTISE REQUIREMENT
To solve this, do you need: (A) Best practices everyone knows, (B) Expert analysis, (C) Safe-to-fail experiments, or (D) Immediate action to stabilize?

**Purpose:** Match approach to domain

### Question 3/5: CLEAR DOMAIN (if A-A)
What is the established best practice for this situation? Can you just follow the standard procedure?

**Purpose:** Sense → Categorize → Respond

### Question 3B/5: COMPLICATED DOMAIN (if A-B)
What experts or analysis methods can reveal the right answer? What data do you need?

**Purpose:** Sense → Analyze → Respond

### Question 3C/5: COMPLEX DOMAIN (if A-C)
What small, safe experiments can you run to see what emerges? How can you amplify what works and dampen what doesn't?

**Purpose:** Probe → Sense → Respond

### Question 3D/5: CHAOTIC DOMAIN (if A-D)
What immediate action creates stability? What stops the bleeding first, analysis later?

**Purpose:** Act → Sense → Respond

### Question 4/5: CONFUSION CHECK
Are you applying the wrong approach (e.g., analyzing when you should experiment, or imposing best practices on a complex situation)?

**Purpose:** Avoid domain mismatch

### Question 5/5: DOMAIN SHIFT
Could this problem move domains? (e.g., Complex becoming Chaotic in crisis, or Complicated becoming Clear as it's understood)

**Purpose:** Anticipate transitions

## Expected Outcome
- Problem type clearly identified
- Appropriate methodology selected
- Avoid analysis paralysis in chaos
- Avoid premature standardization in complexity
- Team alignment on approach

- Part of complexity science tradition

## Tips
- Clear: Use checklists, SOPs
- Complicated: Hire experts, analyze
- Complex: Run experiments, iterate
- Chaotic: Act fast, stabilize first
- Don't impose order too early on complexity
- Watch for domain shifts during crisis
