# Value Proposition Canvas

## Category
STRATEGIC & DECISION-MAKING

## Description
A companion tool to the Business Model Canvas that zooms into two specific blocks: Customer Segments and Value Propositions. Ensures fit between what customers want (jobs, pains, gains) and what you offer (products, pain relievers, gain creators).

## When to Use
- Product-market fit validation
- Product development
- Customer discovery
- Marketing messaging
- Competitive positioning
- Pivot decisions

## Question Sequence (6 questions)

### Question 1/6: CUSTOMER JOBS
What functional, social, or emotional jobs is your customer trying to get done? What tasks are they trying to perform? What problems are they trying to solve?

**Purpose:** Understand customer needs

### Question 2/6: CUSTOMER PAINS
What annoys your customers? What are their frustrations, risks, and obstacles before, during, and after trying to get a job done?

**Purpose:** Identify pain points

### Question 3/6: CUSTOMER GAINS
What outcomes and benefits do your customers want? What would delight them? What would make their jobs easier or more satisfying?

**Purpose:** Identify desired outcomes

### Question 4/6: PRODUCTS & SERVICES
What products and services do you offer that help customers complete jobs, relieve pains, or create gains?

**Purpose:** Map offerings

### Question 5/6: PAIN RELIEVERS
How do your products/services alleviate specific customer pains? Do they eliminate obstacles, reduce risks, or remove frustrations?

**Purpose:** Validate pain relief

### Question 6/6: GAIN CREATORS
How do your products/services create gains for customers? Do they produce outcomes and benefits your customers expect, desire, or would be surprised by?

**Purpose:** Validate value creation

## Expected Outcome
- Clear product-market fit assessment
- Prioritized features based on customer jobs
- Marketing messaging aligned to pains/gains
- Product roadmap validated against customer needs
- Competitive differentiation clarified

## Tips
- Interview real customers (don't assume)
- Prioritize: Not all pains/gains are equal
- Look for "extreme pains" - areas customers desperately need solved
- Aim for "must-have" not "nice-to-have"
- Test with minimum viable product (MVP)
- Achieve "fit" when customers care about your pain relievers and gain creators
