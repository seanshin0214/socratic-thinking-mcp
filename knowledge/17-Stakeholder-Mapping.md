# Stakeholder Mapping (Power-Interest Grid)

## Category
STRATEGIC & DECISION-MAKING

## Description
A strategic tool that identifies all stakeholders affected by a decision or project and maps them by Power (influence) and Interest (concern). Guides engagement strategies to build support, manage opposition, and avoid surprises.

## When to Use
- Change management
- Project planning
- Political navigation
- Product launches
- Policy decisions
- Organizational initiatives

## Question Sequence (5 questions)

### Question 1/5: IDENTIFY ALL STAKEHOLDERS
Who is affected by this decision/project? Who can influence its outcome? List individuals and groups (internal and external).

**Purpose:** Create comprehensive stakeholder list

### Question 2/5: ASSESS POWER
For each stakeholder, what is their level of power/influence over this initiative? (High/Medium/Low power to help or block)

**Purpose:** Map influence

### Question 3/5: ASSESS INTEREST
For each stakeholder, what is their level of interest/concern about this initiative? (High/Medium/Low interest in outcomes)

**Purpose:** Map engagement

### Question 4/5: MAP TO QUADRANTS
Plot stakeholders on 2x2 grid:

**HIGH POWER, HIGH INTEREST** → KEY PLAYERS (Manage Closely)
- Engage frequently, co-create, get buy-in

**HIGH POWER, LOW INTEREST** → KEEP SATISFIED (Monitor)
- Keep informed, don't bore with details, ensure support

**LOW POWER, HIGH INTEREST** → KEEP INFORMED (Communicate)
- Provide information, listen to concerns, build advocates

**LOW POWER, LOW INTEREST** → MONITOR (Minimal Effort)
- Periodic updates, don't over-invest time

Which stakeholders are in each quadrant?

**Purpose:** Prioritize engagement strategy

### Question 5/5: ENGAGEMENT PLAN
For each KEY PLAYER: What do they care about? What's their likely position (support/oppose/neutral)? How will you engage them to gain support?

**Purpose:** Create action plan

## Expected Outcome
- All stakeholders identified (no surprises)
- Power dynamics understood
- Targeted engagement strategies
- Support built early
- Opposition managed proactively

## Tips
- Update regularly (power and interest shift)
- Don't ignore "low power, high interest" - they become vocal critics
- Build coalitions (group stakeholders by common interests)
- For opponents: Understand their concerns, find common ground, mitigate risks
- For supporters: Empower them as champions
- High power stakeholders can move quadrants if their interest changes (e.g., crisis)
