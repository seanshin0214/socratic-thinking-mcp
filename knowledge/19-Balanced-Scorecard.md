# Balanced Scorecard

## Category
STRATEGIC & DECISION-MAKING

## Description
A strategic performance management framework developed by Kaplan and Norton that measures organizational performance across four perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal Process, and Learning & Growth. Balances short-term financial metrics with long-term strategic drivers.

## When to Use
- Strategic planning
- Performance management
- Organizational alignment
- KPI development
- Departmental goal-setting
- Vision execution

## Question Sequence (4 questions)

### Question 1/4: FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE
To succeed financially, what must we achieve? What are our revenue, profitability, cost efficiency, and shareholder value goals?

**Purpose:** Define financial outcomes

**Key Metrics:** Revenue growth, profit margin, ROI, cash flow, cost reduction

### Question 2/4: CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE
To achieve our financial goals, how must we appear to our customers? What value must we deliver? What is our customer value proposition?

**Purpose:** Define customer outcomes

**Key Metrics:** Customer satisfaction, retention rate, market share, Net Promoter Score (NPS), customer acquisition cost

### Question 3/4: INTERNAL PROCESS PERSPECTIVE
To satisfy customers and shareholders, which internal processes must we excel at? What must we do better than competitors?

**Purpose:** Define operational excellence

**Key Metrics:** Quality, cycle time, productivity, innovation rate, process efficiency, time-to-market

### Question 4/4: LEARNING & GROWTH PERSPECTIVE
To achieve our vision, how must our organization learn, change, and improve? What capabilities (people, systems, culture) must we develop?

**Purpose:** Define organizational capacity

**Key Metrics:** Employee engagement, skills development, system capabilities, innovation pipeline, culture index

## Expected Outcome
- Balanced KPIs across 4 perspectives
- Short-term and long-term measures integrated
- Cause-effect relationships visible (e.g., employee training → process quality → customer satisfaction → revenue)
- Strategic alignment from vision to metrics
- Leading indicators (growth, process) and lagging indicators (financial) balanced

## Tips
- Start with strategy, then derive metrics (not the reverse)
- Limit to 4-5 metrics per perspective (16-20 total max)
- Ensure cause-effect logic: Learning & Growth → Internal Process → Customer → Financial
- Review monthly/quarterly (not just annual)
- Avoid metric overload (what gets measured gets managed - choose wisely)
- Common mistake: All financial metrics (ignores strategic drivers)
- Link compensation to scorecard for alignment
