# Worst Possible Idea (Reverse Brainstorming)

## Category
CREATIVE & INNOVATION

## Description
A reverse thinking technique where you brainstorm the worst possible solutions to a problem. By making failure explicit and even humorous, teams relax, surface hidden risks, and often discover surprising insights that lead to better solutions.

## When to Use
- Brainstorming feels stuck
- Team is risk-averse
- Need to surface concerns safely
- Defensive about current approach
- Looking for innovative alternatives
- Breaking groupthink

## Question Sequence (5 questions)

### Question 1/5: REVERSE THE GOAL
Instead of solving [problem], how could you make it WORSE? What would guarantee failure, frustration, or disaster?

**Purpose:** Flip perspective, reduce pressure

### Question 2/5: BRAINSTORM WORST IDEAS
Generate 10-20 terrible ideas. Be creative, absurd, even funny. What's the most ridiculous, counterproductive thing you could do?

**Purpose:** Surface hidden fears and risks

### Question 3/5: IDENTIFY PATTERNS
Looking at your worst ideas, what themes emerge? What are you actually afraid of? What assumptions are revealed?

**Purpose:** Analyze underlying concerns

### Question 4/5: REVERSE THE WORST IDEAS
For each terrible idea, flip it: What's the opposite (which might be a great idea)? Or: What's the kernel of truth that reveals a real risk to avoid?

**Purpose:** Extract insights

### Question 5/5: GENERATE SOLUTIONS
Based on what you've learned, what are 3-5 strong ideas that emerged from this reverse process? What risks should you proactively mitigate?

**Purpose:** Convert to actionable solutions

## Expected Outcome
- Creative tension released
- Hidden concerns surfaced
- Risk awareness increased
- Surprising solutions discovered
- Team alignment on "what not to do"

## Tips
- Make it fun (humor defuses defensiveness)
- No judgment on how bad ideas are
- Often the "worst" idea contains a truth about what you're currently doing wrong
- Common worst ideas reveal actual risks:
  - "Ignore customers" → Are we listening enough?
  - "No testing" → Are we testing enough?
  - "Keep everything secret" → Are we communicating enough?
- Combine with Pre-Mortem for risk planning
- Great for team building (laughter breaks tension)
