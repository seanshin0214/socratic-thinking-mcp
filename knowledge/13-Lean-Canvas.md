## Question Sequence (9 questions)

### Question 1/9: PROBLEM (Top 3)
What are the top 3 problems your customers have? What is the current alternative/workaround they use today?

**Purpose:** Validate problem worth solving

### Question 2/9: CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
Who are your early adopters? Who has this problem most acutely and will pay for a solution?

**Purpose:** Target market focus

What is your single, clear, compelling message that states why you are different and worth buying? What makes you remarkable?

**Purpose:** Differentiation clarity

What are your paths to customers? How will you reach them? (free vs paid, inbound vs outbound)

**Purpose:** Customer acquisition strategy

### Question 6/9: REVENUE STREAMS
What will you charge? What is your revenue model? (pricing, LTV - lifetime value)

**Purpose:** Business model economics

### Question 7/9: COST STRUCTURE
What are your fixed and variable costs? What are the most expensive activities?

**Purpose:** Financial viability

### Question 8/9: KEY METRICS
What key numbers tell you how your business is doing? What do you measure? (e.g., active users, conversion rate, churn, revenue)

**Purpose:** Success measurement

### Question 9/9: UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
What can't be easily copied or bought? What unique advantage do you have that competitors can't replicate? (team, technology, inside info, network effects)

**Purpose:** Sustainable competitive moat
