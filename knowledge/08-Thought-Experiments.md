# Thought Experiments

## Category
CREATIVE & INNOVATION

## Description
Mental simulations that explore hypothetical scenarios to test ideas, challenge assumptions, and discover insights without real-world consequences. Used by Einstein, philosophers, and innovators to breakthrough conventional thinking.

## When to Use
- Testing radical ideas safely
- Challenging constraints
- Exploring edge cases
- Breaking mental models
- Strategic foresight
- Innovation ideation

## Question Sequence (6 questions)

### Question 1/6: EXTREME SCALE
What if your [business/product/problem] was 10x larger or 10x smaller? What would break? What would work differently?

**Purpose:** Reveal scalability assumptions

### Question 2/6: TIME TRAVEL
Fast-forward 10 years: What does success look like? Now reverse-engineer: What must happen in year 1, 3, 5, 7 to reach that future?

**Purpose:** Backcasting from desired future

### Question 3/6: REMOVE CONSTRAINTS
What if [key constraint - money/time/technology] was unlimited? What would you do? Why aren't you doing parts of that now?

**Purpose:** Identify artificial limitations

### Question 4/6: ROLE REVERSAL
What if you were your customer/competitor/regulator? How would you view this situation? What would you do?

**Purpose:** Perspective shift

### Question 5/6: WORST CASE
Imagine the worst possible outcome happened. How did you get there? What early warning signs existed? How could you have prevented it?

**Purpose:** Risk identification (similar to Pre-Mortem)

### Question 6/6: FIRST PRINCIPLES
If you started from scratch today with zero legacy, how would you approach this problem? What are you doing now only because "that's how it's done"?

**Purpose:** Challenge inherited assumptions

## Expected Outcome
- New perspectives on familiar problems
- Hidden assumptions surfaced
- Constraints revealed as negotiable
- Creative solutions identified
- Strategic foresight improved

## Academic Source
- Einstein's elevator thought experiment (General Relativity)
- Rawls' "Veil of Ignorance" (political philosophy)
- Schrödinger's Cat (quantum mechanics)
- Modern use: Strategy consulting, product design

## Tips
- Embrace absurdity initially
- No judgment during exploration
- Look for surprising insights
- Connect back to actionable reality
- Combine multiple thought experiments
- Document "aha moments"
