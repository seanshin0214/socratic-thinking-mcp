# TRIZ Contradiction Matrix (Inventive Problem Solving)

## Category
CREATIVE & INNOVATION

## Description
TRIZ (Russian: Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) developed by Genrich Altshuller identifies that most technical problems involve contradictions - improving one parameter worsens another. The Contradiction Matrix maps 40 inventive principles to resolve these without compromise.

## When to Use
- Engineering problems
- Product design
- Innovation challenges
- Trade-off situations
- "Impossible" problems
- Technical optimization

## Question Sequence (5 questions)

### Question 1/5: DEFINE THE CONTRADICTION
What parameter do you want to IMPROVE? (e.g., speed, strength, reliability, cost)

What parameter WORSENS when you try to improve it? (e.g., complexity increases when speed increases)

**Purpose:** Identify the core trade-off

### Question 2/5: CLASSIFY IMPROVING & WORSENING PARAMETERS
Map to TRIZ's 39 engineering parameters:
- Weight of moving/stationary object
- Length, Area, Volume
- Speed, Force, Power
- Energy, Temperature, Pressure
- Reliability, Durability, Productivity
- Complexity, Automation, Manufacturability
- Etc.

**Purpose:** Frame problem in TRIZ terms

### Question 3/5: CONSULT CONTRADICTION MATRIX
Using the matrix (Improving Parameter × Worsening Parameter), what inventive principles does TRIZ suggest?

**Top 10 Most Common Principles:**
1. **Segmentation** - Divide object into parts
2. **Taking out** - Extract the problematic part
3. **Local quality** - Different parts do different things
4. **Asymmetry** - Replace symmetric with asymmetric
5. **Merging** - Combine identical/similar objects
10. **Preliminary action** - Do it in advance
13. **The other way around** - Invert the problem
15. **Dynamization** - Make it adaptive/flexible
35. **Parameter changes** - Change state (solid→liquid→gas)
40. **Composite materials** - Replace with composites

**Purpose:** Find proven solution patterns

### Question 4/5: APPLY PRINCIPLES TO YOUR PROBLEM
How could you apply the suggested principle(s) to resolve your contradiction WITHOUT compromise? What would [principle] look like in your context?

**Purpose:** Generate innovative solutions

### Question 5/5: EVALUATE & ITERATE
Does this solution truly eliminate the trade-off (ideal) or just optimize it (acceptable)? What new contradictions emerge?

**Purpose:** Refine and test

## Expected Outcome
- Contradiction clearly stated
- Trade-offs eliminated (not just optimized)
- Non-obvious solutions discovered
- Breakthrough innovations
- Patent-worthy ideas

- Modern variants: Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT)

## Tips
- Classic example: Aircraft (improve speed → worsens weight) → Principle 35: Composite materials (carbon fiber)
- "Ideal Final Result" = benefit exists, problem disappears, no new problems
- Don't compromise - seek to ELIMINATE contradiction
- If matrix doesn't help, try: 40 Inventive Principles independently, Separation Principles, or Substance-Field Analysis
- Many principles apply beyond engineering (business, software, process)
