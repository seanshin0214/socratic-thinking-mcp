# Critical Success Factors (CSF)

## Category
STRATEGIC & DECISION-MAKING

## Description
A strategic planning method that identifies the limited number of areas where "things must go right" for the business to flourish. Developed by John Rockart at MIT, CSFs focus effort on the vital few factors that drive success.

## When to Use
- Strategic planning
- Performance management
- Resource allocation
- KPI identification
- New initiative launch
- Turnaround situations

## Question Sequence (5 questions)

### Question 1/5: DEFINE SUCCESS
What does success look like for [business/project/goal] in the next 12-24 months? Be specific about outcomes.

**Purpose:** Clarify desired end state

### Question 2/5: IDENTIFY CRITICAL FACTORS (Brainstorm)
What are the 10-15 things that MUST go right for you to achieve that success? If any of these failed, would success be impossible?

**Purpose:** Generate comprehensive list

### Question 3/5: PRIORITIZE TO VITAL FEW
Which 3-5 factors are truly critical? Use this test: "If we excel at everything EXCEPT this one factor, would we still fail?" If yes, it's a CSF.

**Purpose:** Focus on leverage points

### Question 4/5: ASSESS CURRENT STATE
For each CSF, where are you today on a scale of 1-10? Which CSF is weakest and poses the biggest risk?

**Purpose:** Gap analysis

### Question 5/5: DEFINE MEASURES & ACTIONS
For each CSF, what specific metric(s) will you track? What actions in the next 30-90 days will improve the weakest CSF?

**Purpose:** Execution planning

## Expected Outcome
- 3-5 critical success factors identified
- Non-critical activities deprioritized
- Resources focused on high-leverage areas
- Measurable KPIs defined
- Early warning system for risks

## Academic Source
- Rockart, J. (1979). "Chief Executives Define Their Own Data Needs" (Harvard Business Review, MIT Sloan)
- Used in: Management consulting, IT strategy, balanced scorecard frameworks

## Tips
- CSFs are NOT goals (goals = what, CSFs = critical how)
- Typical CSFs: Customer satisfaction, product quality, financial management, innovation, talent
- Industry-specific examples:
  - SaaS: Customer acquisition cost, churn rate, product-market fit
  - Retail: Location, inventory management, customer experience
  - Consulting: Reputation, client relationships, delivery quality
- Limit to 3-5 (if everything is critical, nothing is)
- Review quarterly (CSFs change as business matures)
- Link CSFs to KPIs for tracking
