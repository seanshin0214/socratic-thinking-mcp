# Causal Loop Diagrams (Systems Mapping)

## Category
CRITICAL & SYSTEMS THINKING

## Description
A visual tool from systems thinking that maps cause-and-effect relationships, feedback loops, and delays in complex systems. Reveals reinforcing loops (exponential growth/decline) and balancing loops (stabilization), helping identify leverage points.

## When to Use
- Understanding complex systems
- Identifying root causes
- Unintended consequences analysis
- Strategic planning
- Policy design
- Organizational change

## Question Sequence (6 questions)

### Question 1/6: IDENTIFY KEY VARIABLES
What are the key factors in this system? What things change over time that matter? (e.g., customer satisfaction, revenue, quality, employee morale)

**Purpose:** Map system elements

### Question 2/6: MAP CAUSAL LINKS
When [Variable A] increases, does [Variable B] increase (+) or decrease (-)? Draw arrows with + or - signs showing relationships.

**Purpose:** Show cause-effect relationships

### Question 3/6: FIND FEEDBACK LOOPS
Are there any cycles where A affects B, B affects C, and C affects A again? Trace the loops. Are they reinforcing (exponential) or balancing (stabilizing)?

**Purpose:** Identify feedback dynamics

### Question 4/6: REINFORCING LOOPS (Virtuous/Vicious Cycles)
What loops create exponential growth or decline? (e.g., "Success → Investment → More Success" OR "Defects → Customer Loss → Less Revenue → More Cuts → More Defects")

**Purpose:** Find accelerators

### Question 5/6: BALANCING LOOPS (Goal-Seeking)
What loops resist change and maintain stability? What mechanisms push the system back toward equilibrium?

**Purpose:** Understand resistance to change

### Question 6/6: DELAYS & LEVERAGE POINTS
Where are significant time delays between cause and effect? Where could a small change have large system-wide impact (leverage points)?

**Purpose:** Strategic intervention

## Expected Outcome
- Visual system map
- Feedback loops identified (reinforcing vs balancing)
- Unintended consequences revealed
- Leverage points for intervention found
- Delays that cause system behavior understood

- Used in: Climate modeling, economics, organizational development

## Tips
- Start simple (5-8 variables max initially)
- Use + and - notation clearly
- Reinforcing loop = even number of negative links (or all positive)
- Balancing loop = odd number of negative links
- Look for delays (they cause oscillations)
- Best leverage points: Change loop structure, not just variables
- Common mistake: Linear thinking (A causes B) instead of circular (A ↔ B)
